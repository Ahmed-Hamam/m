1-Write a program to Print individual numbers from 1 to 100 with two method


2-Write a program function to divide two numbers 
and conditional statement to ensure that the number being divided 
by is not equal to zero.


3-(Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed
to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program
should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial
and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius,
and energy Q is measured in joules.


4-(Game: heads or tails) Write a program that lets the user guess whether the flip of
a coin results in heads or tails. The program randomly generates an integer 0 or 1,
which represents head or tail. The program prompts the user to enter a guess and
reports whether the guess is correct or incorrect.
